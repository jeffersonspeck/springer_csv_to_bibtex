# CSV to BibTeX Converter

## Description
This Python script processes multiple `.csv` files in the same directory, extracts metadata from online articles (if a valid URL is provided), and generates a single `.bib` file in the BibTeX format. The generated BibTeX file is enriched with metadata from the provided URLs, such as article title, abstract, pages, volume, issue, and more.

---

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7 or higher.
2. The following Python libraries:
   - `requests`: To fetch article metadata from the URLs.
   - `beautifulsoup4`: To parse HTML and extract metadata.
   - `tqdm`: To display a progress bar during the process.

Install these libraries with:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 tqdm

## How to Use

### Place CSV Files
Place all `.csv` files to be processed in the same directory as the script.

### Run the Script
Execute the script using the command below. You will be prompted to provide the desired output BibTeX file name:
```bash
python csv_to_bibtex.py

### BibTeX Output:
The script will generate a BibTeX file in the same directory with the name you specify.

### What Happens During the Process:
The script will:
- Read all .csv files in the directory.
- Process each article's metadata, extracting additional information from its URL.
- Display a progress bar and the titles of the articles being processed.
- Save all entries into a single .bib file.

## CSV Input Format

The CSV files should have the following column headers:

- **Item Title**: The title of the article.
- **Publication Title**: The journal or conference name.
- **Journal Volume**: The volume number.
- **Journal Issue**: The issue number.
- **Item DOI**: The DOI of the article.
- **Authors**: The authors of the article (comma-separated).
- **Publication Year**: The year the article was published.
- **URL**: The link to the article.
- **Content Type**: The type of content (e.g., Article, Review).

## BibTeX Output Example

Here is an example of a BibTeX entry generated by the script:

```bibtex
@article{Martin_2006,
  title={Multiple intelligence theory, knowledge identification and trust},
  volume={4},
  DOI={10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500101},
  journal={Knowledge Management Research & Practice},
  author={Martin, Joyce},
  year={2006},
  pages={207-215},
  month={10},
  abstract={This paper presents the results of introducing management students to Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences as a means of increasing respect for the knowledge and abilities of others, which in turn, may increase levels of trust in the ability of others, willingness to share knowledge and trust in equity of knowledge exchanges. The results indicate that most of the participants agreed that the theory raised their awareness of the knowledge of others as well as respect for the knowledge of...

}

## Key Fields in the Output

- **title**: The article's title.
- **volume**: The journal volume number.
- **DOI**: Digital Object Identifier of the article.
- **journal**: The name of the journal or publication.
- **author**: The authors of the article.
- **year**: The publication year.
- **pages**: The start and end pages of the article.
- **month**: The month of publication (if available).
- **abstract**: A summary or abstract of the article.
- **issn**: The ISSN of the journal.

## Notes

- The script automatically handles duplicate BibTeX keys by appending a letter (e.g., `Martin_2006a`, `Martin_2006b`).
- If any required metadata is missing or if a URL fails to fetch metadata, the script will gracefully skip that information.
