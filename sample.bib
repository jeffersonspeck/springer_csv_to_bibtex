  abstract={ This paper presents the results of introducing management students to Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences as a means of increasing respect for the knowledge and abilities of others, which in turn, may increase levels of trust in the ability of others, willingness to share knowledge and trust in equity of knowledge exchanges. The results indicate that most of the participants agreed that the theory raised their awareness of the knowledge of others as well as respect for the knowledge of others and trust in the abilities of others to provide knowledge, willingness of others to share knowledge and trust in an equitable exchange in knowledge sharing. However, large numbers of participants indicated that they remained unsure about the potential effects of their new knowledge on trust. Suggestions for more extensive and intensive research to test the effects of the theory and the proposed model are put forward. },

  abstract={ In all, 187 participants completed a new, self-report measure of eight multiple intelligences (Haselbauer 2005), a General Knowledge test (Irwing et al. Personality and Individual Differences 30:857–871, 2001), a measure of Approaches to Learning Styles (Biggs 1987), a measure of the Big Five personality traits (Costa and McCrae 1992), as well as gave their own estimated scores on the Gardner (1999) multiple intelligences. Alpha co-efficients were modest with only three of the eight test-derived, multiple intelligence scores being over .70. ‘Linguistic’ and Mathematical intelligence alone were correlated with General Knowledge. Five of the eight ‘intelligences’ were correlated both with Extraversion and Openness. Regressions indicated that ‘Intrapersonal intelligence’ was closely linked with Stability and Conscientiousness; ‘Interpersonal intelligence’ with Extraversion; ‘Linguistic intelligence’ with Openness; ‘Mathematical intelligence’ with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Correlations between self-estimated and test-derived emotional intelligence showed correlations ranging from r = .18 to r = .56 for similar type ‘intelligences’. This study provides modest evidence for the concurrent and construct validity of this measure. It requires more psychometric evidence of validity before it is used. },

  abstract={ Who are the people who become positive educational leaders? This essay presents WICS as a model of positive educational leadership. WICS stands for wisdom, intelligence, creativity, synthesized. Each of these elements is asserted to constitute one of the elements of educational leadership. Regrettably, our society is organized around a closed system of selection and talent development that emphasizes intelligence in a narrowly defined way that sometimes ignores its synthesis with creativity and wisdom. },

  abstract={ Multiple intelligences (MI) theory (Gardner, 1983), a pluralistic conception of intelligence, has been adopted by educators in a variety of ways to improve teaching and learning. Some adaptations have included exploring learning styles, designing lesson plans, developing integrated curricula, and adopting authentic forms of assessment. In this case study, a high school science teacher, Jade (a pseudonym), explored MI theory and used it as a conceptual framework to make decisions about how to structure her Grade 9 science curriculum. In studying the case, a variety of data sources and methods were used, including audiotaped planning meetings and interviews, classroom observations, teacher-generated concept maps, and reflective journals. This article describes Jade’s initial explorations of the theory, how she incorporated the theory into her daily teaching, and the outcomes of the study for Jade and her students. In addition, tensions and challenges experienced by Jade in applying the theory to practice and the implications for science teaching and learning are discussed. },
